LIB


That error happens because **RTClib** is not installed for Arduino-CLI yet.

---

### âœ… Install it

```bash
/home/cnc/Desktop/MY_GIT/Arduino_CLI/bin/arduino-cli lib install "RTClib"
```

Or with version:

```bash
/home/cnc/Desktop/MY_GIT/Arduino_CLI/bin/arduino-cli lib install "RTClib@1.14.1"
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Verify installation

```bash
/home/cnc/Desktop/MY_GIT/Arduino_CLI/bin/arduino-cli lib list
```

You should see **RTClib** in the list.

---

After installing, run:

```bash
make build
```

Your TinyRTC sketch should compile successfully.

Do you want me to **update your Makefile to auto-install RTClib** like you did for LiquidCrystal I2C?
